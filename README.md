# Ultimate Duel

## Goal of the game
You must kill your opponent before he does the same with you. You have three lifes which you will lose if you're reached by one of your opponent bullets.
You will only be able to shoot one bullet at a time at the very beginning, but you can enlarge your maximum of ammo with some random upgrades that will appear on the ground.
